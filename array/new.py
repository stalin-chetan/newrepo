Once an array is declared, let us see how individual elemints in the array can be referred.
This is dine with subscript, the number in the brackets following the array name. 
This number specifies the element's positions in the array.
All the array elements are numbered, starting with 0.
Thus , marks[2] is not the second element of the array, but the third.
On our program, we are using the variable i as a subscript to refer to various elements of the array.
This variable can take different values and hence can refer to the different elements in the array in turn.
This ability to use variables to represent subscripts is what makes arrays so useful.

The for loop cause is the process of asking for and receiving a students's markd from the user to be 
repeated 30 times.The first time through the loop, I has a value 0, so the scanf() function will cause
the typed to be stored int the array This process will be repeated until i becomes 29. this is last time
 through the loop which is a good thing, because there is no array element like marks[30]
